4. Immerse the brain in cooling cutting solution for about 1 min, and stick the gel on the sample tab.
5. Take out the brain and cut off cerebellum and medulla vertically.
6. Stick the forebrain to the sample tab.
7. Put the sample tab in the well, and make sure the whole forebrain is immersed by cutting solution.
8. Take on the vibratome, adjuste parameters to 300um and 0.9mm/s.
